# EV(Electric Vehicle)-charging-patterns Interactive dashboard creation using power BI
## Project objectives
This power BI dashboard provides insights into electric vehicles(EV) charging patterns, helping to optimize charging infrastructure and energy grid management. 
## Dataset used
- <a href = "https://github.com/abebag2022/EV-charging-pattern/blob/main/ev_charging_patterns.csv">EV charging pattern/kaggle</a>
## Dashboard Features

. Real-time Charging Status: Visualize the current charging status of EVs, including charging rates and estimated completion times.
. Historical Charging Patterns: Analyze historical charging data to identify trends and patterns, such as peak usage times and charging durations.
. Geographical Distribution: Map EV charging stations and visualize the geographical distribution of charging activity.
. Energy Consumption Analysis: Track energy consumption by EV charging stations and identify areas for optimization.
. User Segmentation: Segment users based on charging behavior, such as frequent chargers, occasional chargers, and overnight chargers.
