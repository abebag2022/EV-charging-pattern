# EV(Electric Vehicle)-charging-patterns Interactive dashboard creation using power BI
## Project objectives
This power BI dashboard provides insights into electric vehicles(EV) charging patterns, helping to optimize charging infrastructure and energy grid management. 
## Dataset used
- <a href = "https://github.com/abebag2022/EV-charging-pattern/blob/main/ev_charging_patterns.csv">EV charging pattern/kaggle</a>
## Dashboard features
-	Visualize the current charging status of EVs, including charging rates and estimated completion times.
-	Analyze historical charging data to identify trends and patterns, such as peak usage times and charging durations.
-	Map EV charging stations and visualize the geographical distribution of charging activity.
-	Track energy consumption by EV charging stations and identify areas for optimization.
-	Segment users based on charging behavior, such as frequent chargers, occasional chargers, and overnight chargers.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Tracks the total amount of energy consumed by EVs.
- Identifies the peak demand period for EV charging.
- Calculates the average time it takes to charge an EV.
- Measures the utilization rate of charging stations.
## How to Use
- Clone the Repository: 
- Open the Power BI File: Double-click the .pbix file to open it in Power BI Desktop.
- Refresh Data: Refresh the data source to ensure the latest information is displayed.
- Explore the Dashboard: Interact with the visualizations to gain valuable insights into EV charging patterns.
## Customization
- Data Source: Update the data source connection to match your specific data source.
- Visualizations: Modify the visualizations to highlight different aspects of the data.
- KPIs: Add or remove KPIs based on your specific needs.
